https://ktor.io/[Ktor] is a Kotlin framework for building connected applications. The `micronaut-ktor` module includes support for using Ktor as the server instead of Micronaut's native HTTP server.

This allows users familiar with Ktor to use Micronaut features such as Dependency Injection, AOP, configuration management and so on.

TIP: See the https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-kotlin/tree/master/examples/greeting[Example application] which demonstrates how to setup a Micronaut Ktor application
